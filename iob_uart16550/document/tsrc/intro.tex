The UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) core provides serial
communication capabilities, which allow communication with modem or other external
devices, like another computer using a serial cable and RS232 protocol. This core is
designed to be maximally compatible with the industry standard National
Semiconductors' 16550A device.
