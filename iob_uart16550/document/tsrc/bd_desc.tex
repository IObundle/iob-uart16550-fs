The core implements the IOb Native SoC bus interface by default for communication with the
system. It has an 8-bit data bus for compatibility reason. The core requires one interrupt.
It requires 2 pads in the chip (serial in and serial out) and, optionally, another six modem
control signals, which can otherwise be implemented using general purpose I/Os on the
chip.

The block diagram of the core is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bd}. It contains the following main components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item IOb Native bus interface
    \item Receiver (FIFO, shift register, logic)
    \item Transmitter (FIFO, shift register, logic)
    \item Baud Generator Logic
    \item Registers: Line Status, Line Control, FIFO Control, Interrupt ID, Interrupt Enable, Modem Status, Modem Control, and Divisor Latches.
    \item Interrupt Logic
    \item Modem Signals Logic
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:bd} is a recreation of the block diagram from the original specification document. The original source file for the diagram was not available.
