The UART16550 testbench is configured to connect the IOb-UART16550 core's RS232 interface in loopback mode. The testbench architecture involves the following components and data flow:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Contains two instances of the IOb-UART16550 core: UART0 and UART1.
  \item Contains two instances of the iob\_universal\_converter core, one for each UART. The universal converter is used to convert the Testbench's IOb bus to the corresponding UART's CSR bus type.
  \item Contains a split core to route the testbench commands to the correct UART.
\end{itemize}

The testbench controller orchestrates the test sequence as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initializes all components.
  \item Write test data to UART0 and read back the data via UART1 for comparison.
  \item Exercise write registers.
  \item Exercise read registers.
  \item Try to read highest CSR address.
  \item Transfer data between both UARTs and test receive CSRs.
\end{enumerate}
